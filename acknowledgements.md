# Acknowledgements

I wouldn't have been able to write this book without the help of many people. They have made me a better programmer. Thanks first and foremost to Ella Batty for inviting me to give the workshop that inspired this book. Thanks to the reviewers, Tyler Sloan, Elizabeth DuPre and Martin Héroux who made the talk much better. Thanks to Ivan Savov for inspiring me to write in long form and for reviewing early versions. Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback on the book, including Kaytee Flick, Tyler Manning, Felix Taschbach, Konrad Kording and Russ Poldrack.
